W.Avy is a potential investor in a new business of surfing and treats. In order to quell any worries he may have about this potential investment, a deep analysis of certain variables will need to be addressed. For this specific analysis, temperature data for the months of June and December are to be analyzed. W.Avy has invested before but had it come crashing down due to lack of foresight concerning the turbulent weather conditions of island life. If the weather shows to be sustainable year round, then the investment should be a sound one. 

Here are three key differences to keep in mind
- the Maximum precipitation for June is higher than both months

- 25% of the preciptation in December is higher than 25% of the precipitation in June

- When you compare the two data sets, you do not see a tremendous amount of change between them. 

## Final Results
The final analysis is very promising. We can see fairly well that the variation in weather year round is not a considerable factor and nearly consistent. W.Avy should feel fairly confident in his investment in this surf and treat shop!
